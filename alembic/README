Generic single-database configuration.

# Description of the alembic folder

The `alembic` folder contains scripts and configuration for database migrations.

- Alembic is used to manage the PostgreSQL (and compatible DBMS) database schema.
- All changes to the database structure (creation/modification of tables, indexes, etc.) are processed as migrations.
- The database connection configuration is taken from the environment variables (see `.env`).
- To apply migrations, use:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

or via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

- To generate a new migration:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "change_description"
```

- All migrations must be tested on SQLite and PostgreSQL.
