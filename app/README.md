# Description of the app folder

The `app` folder contains the main source code of the BattareyCloud FastAPI application.

## Purpose
Modular architecture, test coverage, Docker support and scalability make the project ready for commercial implementation and customization.

## Structure
- **main.py**: FastAPI entry point. Application initialization, router connection, middleware setup (CORS, logging), startup events (e.g. MinIO check).
- **config.py**: Application configuration. Loading settings (database URL, Redis, MinIO, secrets) from environment variables via Pydantic `BaseSettings`.
- **core/**: Core components:
- `security.py`: Password hashing and verification (passlib).
- `encryption.py`: File encryption and decryption logic (cryptography).
- **db/**: Database connection and session management, GUID/JSON types.
- **models/**: SQLAlchemy ORM models (User, File, Folder, FileEncryption, UserSession, UserActivityLog, etc.).
- **repositories/**: Data access layer. CRUD operations and complex selections via SQLAlchemy.
- **routes/**: API endpoints (grouping by entities: users, files, folders, sessions, logs, etc.).
- **schemas/**: Pydantic schemas for validating request and response data.
- **utils/**: Utilities and clients for external services (MinIO, file previews, etc.).
- **__init__.py**: Makes the app folder a Python package.

## Benefits
- Clear separation of layers (routes, business logic, data access, models, schemes)
- Asynchrony for high performance
- Security: encryption, antivirus, validation, sessions, tokens
- Easy scalability and testability

# Description of business logic

- **Registration and authentication:** The user registers by email and password. The password is hashed with bcrypt. JWT is used to access the API.
- **File upload:** Files are encrypted (AES), saved in MinIO. After uploading, the ClamAV background scanning task is launched.
- **File deletion:** The file is marked as deleted (is_deleted=True), physically deleted from MinIO after 24 hours (background cleanup task).
- **Recycle bin:** Recovery is possible before physical deletion. The recycle bin displays only files marked for deletion.
- **Folders:** Nesting, moving, renaming, recursive deletion.
- **Statistics:** Number of files, total size, top 10 by size.
- **Sessions:** User session management (user_sessions).
- **Logs:** User activity logging (user_activity_logs).
- **Settings:** Individual user settings (user_settings).
- **Search and preview:** File search by name/type, preview generation for popular formats.

## Relationships and limitations
- One user can have many files, folders, sessions, logs, settings.
- Folders can be nested (parent_id).
- A file can only be in one folder or in the root (folder_id = NULL).
- Each file has an encryption record (file_encryption).
- When a user is deleted, his files, folders, settings, sessions, logs are deleted in cascade.
- A separate token table is used to reset the password.

# Typical usage scenarios

1. **New user registers, uploads files, gets a download link.**
2. **User deletes file â€” it moves to the trash, physically deleted after 24 hours.**
3. **The user restores the file from the trash before 24 hours have passed.**
4. **The user receives statistics on their files and the top 10 largest files.**
5. **The user creates nested folders and moves files between them.**
6. **After the file is downloaded, an antivirus scan is automatically launched.**

# Installing and updating dependencies

All project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` (in the root of the BackEnd folder).

## Installing new libraries
1. Add the required library to `requirements.txt` (for example, `aiosqlite`).
2. If using Docker, rebuild the backend image:
```bash
docker-compose build backend
```

## Removing a library
1. Remove the line with the library from `requirements.txt`.
2. (Recommended) Rebuild the Docker image:
```bash
docker-compose build backend
```
